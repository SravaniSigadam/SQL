# Write a query that returns a list of the bottom 2% revenue generating restaurants. 
# Return a list of restaurant IDs and their total revenue from when customers placed orders in May 2020.

# You can calculate the total revenue by summing the order_total column. 
# And you should calculate the bottom 2% by partitioning the total revenue into evenly distributed buckets.


# Solution 1
select restaurant_id, order_total
from
(select *, NTILE(50) OVER(order by order_total) as percentile
from
(select restaurant_id, sum(order_total) as order_total
from doordash_delivery
where customer_placed_order_datetime BETWEEN '2020-05-01' AND '2020-05-31'
group by 1)a)b
where percentile =1
order by 2 desc;

# Solution 2
select restaurant_id, order_total
from
(select restaurant_id, sum(order_total) as order_total, NTILE(50) OVER(order by sum(order_total)) as percentile 
from doordash_delivery
where customer_placed_order_datetime BETWEEN '2020-05-01' AND '2020-05-31'
group by 1)a
where percentile =1
order by 2 desc;
