This problem was asked by Stitch Fix.

Assume you are given the below table on transactions from users. 
Write a query to get the number of users and total products bought per latest transaction date where each user is bucketed into their latest transaction date.

user_transactions

column_name type
transaction_id  integer
product_id  integer
user_id integer
spend   float
transaction_date datetime

EX TABLE:
transaction_id  product_id  user_id     spend   transaction_date
1                1           123        100      22 Sep
2                2           123        500      22 Sep
3                1           123        100      21 Sep
4                1           321        100      21 Sep  
5                1           321        100      20 Sep

CTE OUTPUT TABLE:
user_id total_products
123      2
321      1

Solution:

WITH TRANSACTIONS AS 
SELECT user_id, count(*) AS total_products
FROM ( 
SELECT *, RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY user_id ORDER BY transaction_date DESC) AS rank
FROM user_transactions
)
WHERE rank = 1
GROUP BY 1

SELECT  count(*) as number_of_users, SUM(total_products) AS total_products
FROM TRANSACTIONS
