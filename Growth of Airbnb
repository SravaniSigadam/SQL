# Estimate the growth of Airbnb each year using the number of hosts registered as the growth metric. 
# The rate of growth is calculated by taking 
# ((number of hosts registered in the current year - number of hosts registered in the previous year) / the number of hosts registered in the previous year) * 100.
# Output the year, number of hosts in the current year, number of hosts in the previous year, and the rate of growth. 
# Round the rate of growth to the nearest percent and order the result in the ascending order based on the year.
# Assume that the dataset consists only of unique hosts, meaning there are no duplicate hosts listed.
