# StrataScratch
# Display the average number of times a user performed a search which led to a successful booking and the average number of times a user performed 
# a search but did not lead to a booking. The output should have a column named action with values 'does not book' and 'books' as well as a 2nd 
# column named average_searches with the average number of searches per action. 
# Consider that the booking did not happen if the booking date is null. 
# Be aware that search is connected to the booking only if their check-in dates match.
