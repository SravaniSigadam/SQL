# Calculate the percentage of the total spend a customer spent on each order. 
# Output the customerâ€™s first name, order details, and percentage of the order cost to their total spend across all orders. 

# Assume each customer has a unique first name (i.e., there is only 1 customer named Karen in the dataset) and that customers place at most 
# only 1 order a day.

# Percentages should be represented as decimals
