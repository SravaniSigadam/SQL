# You are given a table of product launches by company by year. Write a query to count the net difference between the number of products companies 
# launched in 2020 for the first time with the number of products companies launched in the previous year. 
# Output the name of the companies and a net difference of net products released for 2020 compared to the previous year. 
# If a company is new or had no products in 2019, then any product released in 2020 would be considered as new.
